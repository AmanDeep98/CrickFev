Why?
-----

Mr.X loves to do stuffs in terminal and he is die-hard fan of Cricket.  

Some times due to work, he can not see full live match on screen, so whenever he wants to see score he has to open browser.  

What about a CLI app which will give you update of matches.  


Features
--------

-See live and upcoming events of cricket  
-See scores of all live match  
-See full score-card of a particular match
